# free_showcase
showcase of various free monad/effect handler libs in scala

This project will explore some of the free monad/effect handler libraries to showcase how they can be used.
The use case concerns creating a playlist from a list of tracks
(eg. fetching last.fm loved tracks and creating a youtube playlist via the youtube search).
The project is mainly meant as a sort of experimental playground/showcase for educational purpose.
